# Portfolio-webpage

The layout of this webpage is planned on Figma. 
The coding process was done over codepen.io to be able to constantly check out how the website looks while coding. https://codepen.io/chuabingya/pen/PobbmqZ 
The first release of the code will then be done over visual studio code to check through errors and check if the code works.

## Landing Page

The background is with an astronaut to represent my interest in STEM and personally, I like astronaut themes.
In this page, my full name, Chua Bing Ya, was presented to allow readers to know how to format my fullname
In the next box, bing ya was mentioned instead of my full name to allow reader to know what is my name.

A navigation bar was added to the code to allow easier navigation

## About Me

As of now, this page is plain with the text:
Hi! I am Bing Ya. I am a Year 1 Semester 1 student of the University of Wollongong at the SIM GE campus pursuing the bachelors of computer science. I am currently taking on a double majors, digital systems security and cyber security! 

This section was further expanded because I personally feel like some readers may want information from a specific area rather than a bird eye view (My journey)

The navigation bar was added to show readers the different aspects they can find from this page and allows readers to have an easier time to find the specific detail.


## My Journey
In this section of the portfolio webpage, it aims to introduce what I have done in a timeline format
